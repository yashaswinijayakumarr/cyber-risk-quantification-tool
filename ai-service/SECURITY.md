# Tool-137 Cyber Risk Quantification Tool

## Threat Model

### Threat 1: Prompt Injection
- Description: Attacker manipulates AI prompts to bypass security
- Risk: High
- Mitigation: Input sanitisation, injection pattern detection
- Test: Sent "ignore previous instructions" as input
- Result: PASS — 400 error returned, request blocked

### Threat 2: API Key Exposure
- Description: Groq API key accidentally committed to GitHub
- Risk: High
- Mitigation: Store in .env file, .env added to .gitignore
- Test: Checked git status, verified .env not tracked
- Result: PASS — .env not visible in repository

### Threat 3: Rate Limit Abuse
- Description: Attacker floods endpoints with requests
- Risk: Medium
- Mitigation: flask-limiter set to 30 requests/minute per IP
- Test: Sent 35 requests in sequence
- Result: PASS — requests 31-35 returned 429

### Threat 4: SQL Injection
- Description: Malicious SQL sent in input fields
- Risk: Medium
- Mitigation: bleach sanitisation strips dangerous characters
- Test: Sent "test; DROP TABLE risks;--" as input
- Result: PASS — input blocked

### Threat 5: Excessive Data Exposure
- Description: AI response leaks sensitive internal data
- Risk: Medium
- Mitigation: PII audit on all prompts, no personal data sent to Groq
- Test: Reviewed all prompt templates
- Result: PASS — no PII in any prompt

## Security Tests — Week 1
